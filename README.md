# User Stories
    1.	As a person who needs to improve my productivity,  
I want to document my daily motivation level and journal  
so that I can use the information to make changes in my thoughts and behavior.
    2.	As a person who is having many days where I lack motivation,
I want to use my daily motivation level and journal info
so that I can see patterns that might help me determine what is driving lack of motivation.
    3.	As person who needs to improve my life by improving my motivation,
I want to view what days I had great motivation
so that I determine via my journal what happened or what I thought was important on those days.


# Future Improvements
    1.	Add ability to store information by user id so this web application could be used by anyone.
    2.	Add more characters for journal information so more information about each day can be stored.
    3.	Add more fields that describe what happened during the day to help with analysis of cause and effect of motivation level (physical health, exercise activity, nutritional info).
    4.	Add page to list sources of inspiration that are motivational to me (books, music, people).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
